## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffold: npm workspaces, TypeScript project references, type-aware
  ESLint, Prettier, Vitest with separate unit and integration projects, and CI.
- `@budget/shared`: integer-cent money primitives (parsing, formatting, even and
  weighted distribution, JSON serialization), the budget identity and its
  labelling, and the domain vocabulary shared with the UI.
- PostgreSQL schema covering accounts, groupings, delegations, the delegation
  event ledger, delegate runs, envelope transfers, transactions and allocations,
  auto-categorization rules, users and sessions, sync runs, valuations, Bitcoin
  price history and settings.
- Hand-written integrity migration: case-insensitive partial unique indexes on
  live names, and check constraints the database enforces itself.
- Domain services: the event ledger with transactional cached balances, Delegate
  with preview and 12-hour undo, envelope transfers, manual adjustment,
  categorization and splits, pending reconciliation and reversal, archiving rules,
  and go-live reconciliation.
- `recompute-balances` CLI, with a read-only `--check` mode used by CI.
- 116 tests, including integration tests against a real PostgreSQL asserting the
  identity behaves correctly after delegate, undo, transfer, adjust, categorize,
  split, pending appearing, pending vanishing and archiving.
- Documentation: architecture, six ADRs, phase-gated open questions.
- CI check rejecting the forbidden terminology for the Bitcoin asset class.
